# Flipper

A digital version of the classic card flipping memory game made purely using Tkinter.

- The Top left corner shows the current number of clicks and the top right corner shows the minimum number of clicks in whch the game was completed. 
- The middle button is to start a new game and can be called anytime during or after the game is completed. 
- The tiles are arranged in a random order for every new game
- Once, a matching pair of tiles is found, they are unclickable.
- If two tiles are clicked such that they are not matching, the uncovered tile will flip back and the player has to remember it's loaction.
- The goal is to uncover all the tiles in the minimum number of clicks.
